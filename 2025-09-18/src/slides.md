For a little bit more about my story, I started my journey in Open Source with a personal project called BreadSplit. 

[click] From that, I made a VS Code extension i18n-ally and then VueUse, the utilities library for Vue. And since then, I started to contribute a lot more to open source projects, [click] like Vue and Vite. I made tools like [click] Slidev, joined [click] Nuxt team, and then made [click] Vitest, etc. And ended up to be, [click] probably too many projects. [click]

I don't know how much you know about them or already using some. What I want to say is that I feel extremely lucky to be able to work on these projects, make them useful for the community, and eventually get me this great chance to stand here and give this talk to you. Thanks to everyone for coming here and thanks to the organizers for holding this event and inviting me here.

<!--
So, for today's topic, although I might be a bit overreaching to take this ambitious topic, I'd like to share with you my experience and thoughts on how we could make tools that people love.

I hope it can give you some insights or inspiration on your own journey.

<TipTitle title="I Don't Know" number="1" description="We can't Know without Trying" />

<!--
So, let's go straight into the topic, to talk about how to make tools that people love, the very first tip I would give is - [click]I don't know. (pause)

Well, I mean, I really don't know. We don't know.

There is no such things called "10 tips to success", and there is no formula to say we can definitely make people love our tools.

[click] What we have to do is to try and error, to work with the community, to hear them back, verify, evaluate and iterate.

  <div ma text-2em font-serif v-click>Lower Your Expectations</div>
  <div ma text-2em font-serif v-click>Verify with the Community</div>
</div>

<!--
The real tip I would put it here is to try more and don't be a afraid to fail.

Even tho I made quite a lot of tools people use, I actually have way more tools that discontinued or didn't work out.

And that's totally fine for me as I consider them as a learning and experimenting process.

[click] For that, I would also say, don't set too high expectations. It's easy for us to get excited about the idea we are working on, but they might not necessarily be the best fit for the community.

[click] Then I would suggest to establish a mechanism to verify if your idea with the community.

So for the following tips, I would share some practical tips that I learned from my own experience.

<TipTitle 
  title="Solve Your Own Problems"

<!--
The second tip I would give is to [click] Solve your own problems first. You should be your first user of your tool, or you should be the reason why you made the tool in the first place.

[click] I see this is great ways for myself to come up with good ideas and find good motivation to keep them moving.

<!--
I'd say to build from your own pain points is [click] a great way to come up with ideas and provide you strong motivation to work on it.

[click] From the perspective of needs, because our it comes from the problems we encounter ourselves, starting from our own needs allows us to have a deeper understanding of the problem and potential solutions.

[click] And our motivation comes from solving our own problems, with some the possibility that it might also help others.

[click] Furthermore, our needs are likely to be shared by others, and we can validate our ideas through the community.

[click] Finally, through community discussions and contributions, we can iterate on our designs and improve our solutions to serve even boarder senarios.

By following this approach, we can gather the essential elements for the continuous development of the projects - what we are skilled at and enjoy, and what the community needs.

<TipTitle

<!--
Then the third tip I would give is to be [click] Progressive.

[click] Progressive means we should reduce the friction for people to onboarding and use our tools.

It's meaningless to craft a great tool that no one know how to use right?

  </div>
  <div op75 v-click>Deprecate & Warning ‚Üí Forward/Backward Compatibility ‚Üí Remove</div>
</div>

</div>

<!--
Specifically, I think we should be progressive on the following aspects:

[click] The first would be onboarding, [click] we should make it easy to understand and get started. [click] The tip I would give is to see if you can well describe your tool clearly within one sentence. If you can't, you might have made the tool too complicated.

[click] Then we should be progressive on features, [click] starts minimal and grows with users. [click] We should make the tool useful even in the simplest cases. For example, Vite can start with a single `index.html` file and no more. Nuxt can start with a single `app.vue` file, etc. It's easy to have many features as possible into our tool to make it more useful, but it could be overwhelming for the users to start with a lot of features. We need to find a way to reveal features when users need them.

[click] Then it's about extensibility, [click] to allow community to enhance the tool and enrich the ecosystem. [click] We should make a plugin system for users to extend it with their needs.

[click] Finally, we should be progressive on breaking changes, [click] to provide middle stages for migration. This is probably the most important one to me in software development. Breaking changes are necessary for software to improve, but how we do that is also crucial. [click] A common practice is to deprecate the old features and provide a warning for the users to migrate to the new features. Then we could provide forward/backward compatibility for the users to opt-in to the new behaviour in legacy versions, or stay on the old behaviour in the new versions, for them to migrate at their own pace. And finally, we could remove the old features after a certain period of time. Each of these steps would deserve a major version and should take slowly.

<TipTitle
  title="Extensible"
  description="Plugins system. Community driven."
  number="4"
/>

<!--
So we have mentioned a bit about extensibility in the previous slide.

So the fourth tip I would give is [click] to be extensible, [click] to make a plugin system for your tool and allow community to enhance it.

<div text-1.6em text-lime>should provide <span v-mark="1">a Plugin System</span></div>

that in my opinion,

all the software,

[click] should provide some kind of plugins system. (pause)

  Tools
</div>

<div v-click absolute left-0 right-0 bottom-20 italic font-serif text-center>
  "Software is logic that adapts"
</div>

<!--
Before I explain it, I wanted to first give my understanding towards the definition of the word "Scripts" and "Software".

How do you feel about these words? (pause)

Even tho Scripts and Software are technically the same thing under the hood, they are also different when you look at them from the perspective of the users.

[click] I would describe Scripts as a one-off tool that you use to solve a specific problem, and most of the time, you throw them away after you use them. They can be still very useful and saving you a lot of time, but the code itself is usually not reusable.

[click] Software on the other hand, is a tool that you use to solve a general problem, and you can use it for a long time. You can have it adapt to different scenarios for others with different needs.

[click] So I would say, Software is logic that adapts. The adaptability gives life to the code we wrote and benefits others in the long run.

Why we are talking about this? I think extensibility one of the very important ways to make software have more adaptability. For extensibility, we usually mean a plugin system.

# Benefits {.font-serif}

of Having a Plugins System

<div h-15 />

<v-clicks>

- Allow community to build features without being blocked.

- Verify ideas without breaking changes to core.

- Better architecture.

- Maximizing the value of being a tool.

</v-clicks>

<!--
Talk about the benefits of having a plugins system, I would give a few points here.

[click] First it would allow you to build a community around your tool. And would give the community power to build extensible features without being blocked by you or the maintainers. This also means it will scale better.

[click] Then, as the author or the maintainer, you can also leverage the plugin system to experiment and verify your ideas without breaking changes to the core. You can implement an experimental feature as an opt-in plugin for people to try it and iterate it freely, once it's stable enough, you can then consider if you want to merge it to the core, etc.

[click] Then, making a plugin system, especially a powerful one, would also help you to design a better architecture for your tool. You can have a more flexible and extensible architecture, which is also more maintainable in the long run.

[click] Finally, as we mentioned before, having a plugin system would help your tool to be more extensible and and cover more use cases, which would benefit more people.

<TipTitle
  title="Make Core Feature Plugins" 
  description="To verify you have a powerful plugin API."
  number="4.1"
/>

<!--

With that in mind, I would say a good way to build a powerful plugin system is to make your core features as plugins.

This would put yourself at the positions of API designer and API consumer at the same time, which would help you to design a more powerful plugin system.

<!--

Let's take Vite as an example.

I don't know how much of you are familiar with the history of Vite. Vite as for today is almost the by default choose for web development for almost any projects, but at the very beginning, [click] it was an experiment on developmenting tooling specifically for Vue.

As the idea of having native-ESM dev server seems to work pretty well, Evan started to think that we could have this great hot module reload experience for other frameworks as well. [click] Start from Vite v2.0+, Vite became a framework-agnostic frontend tooling that is not bound to Vue anymore. [click] Instead, Evan extracted the hard-coded Vue-specific logic into a plugin, this also helps to ensure Vite has a very powerful plugin system.

[click] Then we have plugin to support React, [click] community built the plugin for Svelte which later become official, [click] then we could have some crazy ideas like running a test runner for Vite with the same plugins pipeline, [click] or until then we have almost every meta-frameworks built on top of Vite and share the great plugin ecosystem from Vite.

<TipTitle
  title="Work with the Community"
  description="Work with people, get them engaged, build together."
  number="5"
/>

<!--
Then, the final tip I would give today is [click] to Work with the Community. Or work with the users, depends on what type of the tools you are building.

[click] We can't build a great tool without the community, we need to work with people, get them engaged and build together.

      <div text-blue2>Extend the ecosystem by introducing new integrations.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<!--

The first thing I would suggest is to [click] build your own identify. People need to know who is behind the tool, especially in open source. Software as tools is a bit different from physical tools, software evolves and needs maintenance, knowing and trusting the authors or maintainers behind a certain tool is important.

[click] Then, of course, we should work with our users. Listen to their feedback and iterate.

[click] Building a software tool, especially dev tools is interesting, as your users are usually also developers, meaning they could potentially contribute to the tool themselves. Make a good environment for contributions and maintain a good feedback-loop for them is important to get your tool started. For example, like reply to comments or review the PR in time, to make people feel they are part of the community, which potentially you could gather people with the same passion about the tool and maybe build a team to scale the project further.

[click] Finally, we should collaborate with other projects/authors/maintainers, our side of our project. Not only we could extend the ecosystem by introducing new integrations, but also we could learn from each others, spark with new ideas, and build a stronger community together.
