<!--
So you might have already heard about the plan of Vite Plus, which is aimed to provide a unified toolchain for the JavaScript ecosystem.

From Vite as the starting point, we are building Rolldown and the underlying Oxc, that would provide fast and more consistent Linter, Formater, Bundler, Minifier etc.

On top of Vite, we will also integrate Vitest as part of the Vite Plus ecosystem for testing on both Node.js and browser.

With such a grant roadmap, we also want to provide some UI devtools for better visualization and analysis experiences. This is where Vite DevTools comes into the view.

<!--

For a more concrete example,

We know that we have the CLI `vite dev` for dev server and `vite build` for building the production bundle.

We are going to have `vite test` which will be powered by Vitest to run your test suites.

Then we will have `vite lint` and `vite format` powered by Oxc, which going to be the same parser as Vite on Rolldown.

And then we might have `vite lib` for building libraries that are built on top of `tsdown` and Rolldown.

And so on. As we mentioned, the goal is to provide a single unified toolchain with incredible performance for JavaScript ecosystem.

About Vite DevTools, it going to be presented as a cli flag `--ui` for all the sub command and show the UI interface for each operation and understand the internal better.

<!--
Before we talk about why, let's first discuss what **IS** DevTools.

When we talk about the DevTools, it can either means [click] the general developer tools, or the [click] specialized term, DevTools.

I would define the general developer tools, [click] the tools for developers. In that sense, the tools we use daily in our developement like [click] Vite, Vitest, Vue, Nuxt, etc, are all developer tools.

On the other hand, for the special DevTools, we usually mean [click] the tools for using tools better.
For example, [click] we know Chrome have the DevTools builtin, and then we have Nuxt DevTools, Vue DevTools, etc.

The DevTools we are going to talk about today all refer to the later.

Why we are building tools for using tools?

If you think about what makes a good tool, I would give the following points.

The first thing is the [click] Entry Barrier, [click] A good tools should be easy to start with, easy to config, and usually easy to be explained with in one single sentence.

Then the second would be [click] Intuitive, [click] we should meets users' expactations and intuition, to make good developer experience and easy to discover new features.

The third I would pick is [click] Transparency, [click] when using a tool, it's better for users to know how it works and what's its state. If something went wrong, we could find out why and fix them easier.

Then it would be [click] Composability, [click] having decoupled modules would make features easier to combine and extend with other tools to leverage the full power.

The final one I would pick is [click] Extensibility, [click] What make software different from one-off scripts is that software are about to adopt and handle different scenarios. And being extensible by having flexile plugin system and ability to customize is one of the very important aspects of good software.

That said, the reason we are building DevTools is trying to provide the great [click] Transparency to our tools, to help the users understand the tools better and see through the internal state.

  UnoCSS Inspector

<img src="/devtools/uno-inspector.png" w-250 />

<!--
My personal journey with building DevTools starts with UnoCSS. As UnoCSS generates CSS utilities on-demand based on the codebase. When working on that, one thing I found tricky is to know why one utility was included and why the other is not. So I built this inspector to show how each file is scanned and how they are contributed to the utilities list, etc. This kind of transparency helped us to build the engine more efficient with better accuracy.

<!--
If you think about the UI we just talked about, you will find that you might often need them, or they could be a bit too advanced to our daily development.

[click] This is actually totally make sense, because Vite is a framework-agnostic tool. Agnostic means that we don't know about the framework you use, we shouldn't know. This gives Vite great flexibility and extensibility to be the infrastructure of modern framework, but also made Vite hard to present the interesting information that are more closer to the actual Vite users, like the app we are building, or the state of the framework we are using etc.

[click] If you look at the graph on the right, imagine each circle represents a specific framework or intergrations. Being agnostic means that Vite DevTools can only be the [click] common divisor among all the frameworks, which is not quite limited to always useful to the majority of the users.

[click] That's why the next thing we are going to talk about is, Extensibility. In order to bring intersting, framework specific information to the users, we have to provide the capability for frameworks to do so.

<DevToolsKit />

<!--
If you have watched my previous talks, this is a slide I made in roughly two years ago when presenting Nuxt DevTools, [click] picturing the idea of having a shared interface for building DevTools, called DevTools Kit.

[click] The idea is trying to create a modular, composable, collabrative DevTools ecosystem.

[click] For example, we know that we have some features that are general and not coupled with other frameworks. [click] Then we have features from the VIte Plus ecosystem, like Vitest and [click] Oxc related tools like linting anf formating.
[click] Maybe going to the frontend, we could also have some general web related information like SEO, accessibility, PWA and so one.

[click] Going specific to the frameworks, let's take Vue as an example, we might have UI for visualizing components, reactivity, routers, etc. [click] Going further, we have meta-framework like Nuxt that would also serving Nuxt-specific visualizations.

// TODO: fix clicks, add tanstack, node modules?

[click] In that sense, we might also have tools for React, [click] for Svelte, [click] for Solid, [click] for Qwik and so on.

[click] Then we could have tools integrations as well.

If you think all of these blocks are pluggable extensions, then we could compose them easily based on our needs. for example, [click] taking all the Vue and Nuxt feature, we could have Nuxt DevTools. [click] without Nuxt-specific parts, we could have Vite DevTools. [click] SImilarly we could have DevTools for other frameworks easily [click] [click] [click] under the same infrastructure. And in the end, you might be able to customize it based on your projects' specific needs and have [click] Your own DevTools.

</div>

<!--
The original idea of DevTools Kit was discontinued due to various reasons, mainly because we are not sure how much people would adopt to it. 

But this time is different, since we are building the DevTools for Vite, it means that when it's ready, all the frameworks built on top of Vite would naturally benefit form without friction.

[click] So we are bringing the vision of DevTools kit to Vite DevTools, instead of asking DevTools authors to migrate to a common pattern, now they will just be building plugins for Vite.

<!--
Let's take a glance at how the Vite DevTools Plugin would look.

So in general, a Vite DevTools plugin would be [click] a superset of Vite Plugin, meaning you don't need to do anything special, but only [click] by adding a `devtools` hook to your plugin, it would work. The code on the right is a pseudo-code snippet of how you would do that. And it actually already works, but the reason I called it pseudo is because nothing is set in stone yet and we are still expoloring the interface and it might change a lot.

[click] Vite DevTools will provide the built-in RPC, remote-procedure call, layer for plugin authors to extend and communicate between the server and clients more easily.

[click] We also wanted to make it possible for users to decide the ways to consume the devtools. In Vite DevTools, we will support an embedded floating panel, similar to Nuxt DevTools, or via a browser extension to be presented in the browser DevTools, or a standalone webpage, or a deployable SPA as a snapshot of your current data, etc. Vite DevTools will provide the abstraction layer for supporting these scenarios isomorphically.

<!--
On a broader view, the goal and vision of Vite DevTools is that we will provide better transparency and enable the capability for the ecosystem to explore even further.

[click] Built-in, we will provide visualizations of the Vite internals, [click] Analysis and actionable suggestions for your build and plugins pipeline, [click] Build comparison across multiple commits to see how your app changes over time, [click] Build snapshots via deployable SPA for you to even share your build meta as reproduction, and so on.

[click] Then we're going to have first-party Vite Plus integrations like Vitest UI and Oxlint, [click] And finally the DevTools Kit for plugin authors to build on top of this infra and create even more interesting use cases.

<!--
The scope of Vite DevTools becomes pretty big, and it takes a bit longer than we expected.

So currently we have [click] implemented quite some [click] visualizations, as we talked before.

And then [click] we are continuing to work on having more insight for bundle analysis, which we are working closely with the Rolldown team on this. [click] We had the DevTools Kit baseline working already have some prototype of porting Nuxt DevTools to Vite DevTools working, but there is a lot of polishing that needs to be done and documents to be written.

[click] Currently, the core UI of Vite DevTools is focusing on build mode only, and we are waiting for the Vite full bundle mode to roll out to support the development mode.

[click] And finally, in the long term, we want to work and collaborate with the ecosystem to bring the effort together and have everybody benefit from this system.

In short, unfortunately, Vite DevTools is not yet usable at this moment, and we are actively working on it. Please be patient and stay tuned, we will let you know when it's ready to try!

Finally, I'd like to say thank you to [click] Arlo who had helped a lot on the development of Vite DevTools; [click] Guillaume for being so inspiration for his previous work on Vue DevTools and testing frameworks UIs, while also brainstormed and prototyped the idea of DevTools together. [click] Then YunFei for coordinates on the Rolldown side to provide APIs that made Vite DevTools possible. [click] And great thanks to Sebastien who seeded the idea of Nuxt DevTools, and invested me so much on building it and now for Vite.

<!--
The source code is located at repository `vitejs/devtools`, go check it out! There are many things going on at the same time so it could be overwhelming, but we will try to improve the contributions guides and docs in the mean time for you to contribute better.

I am really looking forward to seeing how we could work with the whole ecosystem to explore and build even better toolings.

Thank you!
