<!--
You might have already heard about the Vite Plus plan, which aims to provide a unified toolchain for the JavaScript ecosystem.

Starting from Vite, we're building Rolldown and the underlying Oxc, which will provide fast and more consistent linting, formatting, bundling, and minification.

On top of Vite, we'll also integrate Vitest as part of the Vite Plus ecosystem for testing on both Node.js and browser environments.

With such an ambitious roadmap, we also want to provide UI devtools for better visualization and analysis experiences. This is where Vite DevTools comes into play.

[click] Then we'll have `vite lint` and `vite format` powered by Oxc, which will use the same parser as Vite and Rolldown.

<!--
Before we talk about why, let's first discuss what **IS** DevTools.

When we talk about DevTools, it can either mean [click] general developer tools, or the [click] specialized term, DevTools.

I would define general developer tools as [click] tools for developers. In that sense, the tools we use daily in our development like [click] Vite, Vitest, Vue, Nuxt, etc., are all developer tools.

On the other hand, for the special DevTools, we usually mean [click] tools for using tools better.
For example, [click] we know Chrome has built-in DevTools, and then we have Nuxt DevTools, Vue DevTools, etc.

The DevTools we're going to talk about today all refer to the latter.

<!--
Why are we building tools for using tools?

If you think about what makes a good tool, I would give the following points.

The first thing is the [click] Entry Barrier, [click] A good tool should be easy to start with, easy to configure, and usually easy to explain in one single sentence.

Then the second would be [click] Intuitive, [click] we should meet users' expectations and intuition, to create a good developer experience and make it easy to discover new features.

The third I would pick is [click] Transparency, [click] when using a tool, it's better for users to know how it works and what its state is. If something goes wrong, we can find out why and fix it more easily.

Then it would be [click] Composability, [click] having decoupled modules would make features easier to combine and extend with other tools to leverage their full power.

The final one I would pick is [click] Extensibility, [click] What makes software different from one-off scripts is that software is meant to adopt and handle different scenarios. Being extensible with a flexible plugin system and the ability to customize is one of the very important aspects of good software.

That said, the reason we're building DevTools is to provide great [click] Transparency for our tools, to help users understand the tools better and see through the internal state.

  UnoCSS Inspector

<img src="/devtools/uno-inspector.png" w-250 />

<!--
My personal journey with building DevTools starts with UnoCSS. Since UnoCSS generates CSS utilities on-demand based on the codebase, when working on it, one thing I found tricky was knowing why one utility was included and why another wasn't. So I built this inspector to show how each file is scanned and how they contribute to the utilities list. This kind of transparency helped us build the engine more efficiently with better accuracy.

<!--
If you think about the UI we just talked about, you'll find that you might not often need them, or they could be a bit too advanced for daily development.

[click] This actually makes total sense, because Vite is a framework-agnostic tool. Agnostic means that we don't know about the framework you use, and we shouldn't know. This gives Vite great flexibility and extensibility to be the infrastructure of modern frameworks, but it also makes it hard for Vite to present interesting information that's closer to actual Vite users, like the app we're building or the state of the framework we're using, etc.

[click] If you look at the graph on the right, imagine each circle represents a specific framework or integration. Being agnostic means that Vite DevTools can only be the [click] common divisor among all frameworks, which is quite limited and not always useful to the majority of users.

[click] That's why the next thing we're going to talk about is Extensibility. In order to bring interesting, framework-specific information to users, we have to provide the capability for frameworks to do so.

<DevToolsKit />

<!--
If you've watched my previous talks, this is a slide I made roughly two years ago when presenting Nuxt DevTools, [click] picturing the idea of having a shared interface for building DevTools, called DevTools Kit.

[click] The idea is to create a modular, composable, collaborative DevTools ecosystem.

[click] For example, we know that we have some features that are general and not coupled to other frameworks. [click] Then we have features from the Vite Plus ecosystem, like Vitest and [click] Oxc-related tools like linting and formatting.
[click] Maybe going to the frontend, we could also have some general web-related information like SEO, accessibility, PWA, and so on.

[click] Going specific to frameworks, let's take Vue as an example, we might have UI for visualizing components, reactivity, routers, etc. [click] Going further, we have meta-frameworks like Nuxt that would also provide Nuxt-specific visualizations.

[click] In that sense, we might also have tools for React, [click] for Svelte, [click] for Solid, [click] for Qwik and so on.

[click] Then we could have tool integrations as well.

If you think all of these blocks are pluggable extensions, then we could compose them easily based on our needs. For example, [click] taking all the Vue and Nuxt features, we could have Nuxt DevTools. [click] Without Nuxt-specific parts, we could have Vite DevTools. [click] Similarly, we could have DevTools for other frameworks easily [click] [click] [click] under the same infrastructure. And in the end, you might be able to customize it based on your project's specific needs and have [click] your own DevTools.

<!--
The original idea of DevTools Kit was discontinued due to various reasons, mainly because we weren't sure how many people would adopt it.

But this time is different. Since we're building the DevTools for Vite, it means that when it's ready, all frameworks built on top of Vite would naturally benefit from it without friction.

[click] So we're bringing the vision of DevTools Kit to Vite DevTools, instead of asking DevTools authors to migrate to a common pattern, now they'll just be building plugins for Vite.

Let's take a glance at how the Vite DevTools Plugin would look.

So in general, a Vite DevTools plugin would be [click] a superset of a Vite Plugin, meaning you don't need to do anything special, but only [click] by adding a `devtools` hook to your plugin, it would work. The code on the right is a pseudo-code snippet of how you would do that. And it actually already works, but the reason I called it pseudo is because nothing is set in stone yet and we're still exploring the interface, and it might change a lot.

[click] Vite DevTools will provide the built-in RPC, remote-procedure call, layer for plugin authors to extend and communicate between the server and clients more easily.

[click] We also wanted to make it possible for users to decide the ways to consume the devtools. In Vite DevTools, we will support an embedded floating panel, similar to Nuxt DevTools, or via a browser extension to be presented in the browser DevTools, or a standalone webpage, or a deployable SPA as a snapshot of your current data, etc. Vite DevTools will provide the abstraction layer for supporting these scenarios isomorphically.

</SlidevVideo>

<!--

So here is how it would look. In general, we will provide a dock-like UI to be the entry point of all the integrations. For each integration, we provide frames to render each DevTools UI, or it can be a custom renderer or running scripts. Here is a quick PoC to have Vitest, Nuxt DevTools, and UnoCSS integrated. In the future we will work with more DevTool authors to bring them to Vite DevTools, while also verifying the capability of our plugin API.

<!--
On a broader view, the goal and vision of Vite DevTools is that we will provide better transparency and enable the ecosystem to explore even further.

[click] Built-in, we will provide visualizations of the Vite internals, [click] Analysis and actionable suggestions for your build and plugin pipeline, [click] Build comparison across multiple commits to see how your app changes over time, [click] Build snapshots via deployable SPA for you to even share your build metadata as reproduction, and so on.

[click] Then we're going to have first-party Vite Plus integrations like Vitest UI and Oxlint, [click] and finally the DevTools Kit for plugin authors to build on top of this infrastructure and create even more interesting use cases.

<!--
The scope of Vite DevTools has become pretty big, and it's taking a bit longer than we expected.

So currently we have [click] implemented quite a few [click] visualizations, as we talked about before.

And then [click] we're continuing to work on having more insights for bundle analysis, which we're working closely with the Rolldown team on. [click] We have the DevTools Kit baseline working and already have some prototype of porting Nuxt DevTools to Vite DevTools working, but there's a lot of polishing that needs to be done and documentation to be written.

[click] Currently, the core UI of Vite DevTools is focusing on build mode only, and we're waiting for the Vite full bundle mode to roll out to support development mode.

[click] And finally, in the long term, we want to work and collaborate with the ecosystem to bring the effort together and have everybody benefit from this system.

In short, unfortunately, Vite DevTools is not yet usable at this moment, and we're actively working on it. Please be patient and stay tuned - we'll let you know when it's ready to try!
